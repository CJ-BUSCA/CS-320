Developers should work in an environment that recommends specific patterns and promotes security best practices through background notifications to guarantee that code, programs, or software is functional and secure.
Additionally, they should base their choice of programming language and framework on the demands placed on the project and their organization.
Understanding a language's strengths and shortcomings to be aware of the difficulties is one technique for developers to guarantee functionality.
Finally, developers should automate their procedures to make adopting security best practices simpler.
Instead of performing security scans solely at the end of the process, the intention is to encourage developers to repair bugs as they arise. 

User needs are specifications that improve a user's environment, service, or product.
We need to engage in a process where users understand their issues, solutions, objectives, and preferences to incorporate user needs into a program.
Examples include functions.
The tasks that a user must do are as follows.
The functionality gives developers ideas on what to build and how to use it.
Accessibility is next.
Users with various talents and traits should be surveyed regarding their demands.
The final category features are related to functions because they specify how procedures are carried out.
Although not necessary, features are a way of meeting needs. 

There are two methods that we use while designing software.
One is the "bottom-up" methodology, in which the design process begins with the minor possible components and subsystems.
Then, utilizing these components, the following immediate higher-level components and subsystems are built or assembled.
This strategy can be combined with the top-down method to hide the implementation's low-level details.
The top-down technique is the next, in which each system is broken down into several subsystems and components.
The subsystems and components that make up each subsystem is further broken down.
This division method makes it easier to create a hierarchy within the system.
The top-down approach's key benefit is that it places a heavy emphasis on requirements, which makes a design adaptable to the user's needs.
